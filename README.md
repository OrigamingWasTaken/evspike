EV3 Paster is a HTML webpage made to run locally in the browser. It supports merging 2 `.lmsp` files.

## How to use?

You can __drag and drop__, or __click the button__ to select a **main** file. The main file is the file you want to copy the blocks into.

You also need to upload your **From** file. This files contains the blocks, variables, etc that will be copied over to the main file.
